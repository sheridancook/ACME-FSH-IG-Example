It is informed by the IPS-UV Composition profile, but differs in its application of MS flags on some of the sections to allow for jurisdictional implementers flexibility in what sections systems must support in order to show conformance to their respective patient summaries. The PS-CA dataset is minimal and non-exhaustive; specialty-agnostic and condition-independent; but still clinically relevant. Its informed by the requirements specified in EN 17269 and ISO/DIS 27269, it is designed for supporting the international use case scenario for ‘unplanned, cross border care’, but is also designed to support a variety of use cases for cross-jurisdiction exchange.
