  "description": "This profile defines a set of constraints to the FHIR Composition resource for use in Alberta Patient Summaries (PS-AB). It re-profiles the PS-CA Composition profile and refines constraints applied to the Composition resource by the PS-CA project. \r\n\r\nA Canadian Patient Summary (PS-CA) document is an electronic health record extract containing essential healthcare information about a subject of care. It is informed by the IPS-UV Composition profile, but differs in its application of MS flags on some of the sections to allow for jurisdictional implementers flexibility in what sections systems must support in order to show conformance to their respective patient summaries. The PS-CA dataset is minimal and non-exhaustive; specialty-agnostic and condition-independent; but still clinically relevant. Its informed by the requirements specified in EN 17269 and ISO/DIS 27269, it is designed for supporting the international use case scenario for ‘unplanned, cross border care’, but is also designed to support a variety of use cases for cross-jurisdiction exchange. It is intended to guide implementation nationally while ensuring international exchange of patient summaries is not impeded.\r\n\r\nThis profile is based on the ClinicalDocument profile from the base R4 FHIR standard.",
